## `who`

👋 I'm Chris. 

I work at Google as a Staff Developer Programs Engineer on Google Cloud ☁️ building Client Libraries for products like [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/quickstart-servers#add_data) 🔥, [Bigtable](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/writing-data#simple) 🏓, and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects#storage-upload-object-code-sample) 💽.

For more about me check out [chriswilcox.dev](https://chriswilcox.dev) for tech related content. 

Outside of tech [I am an avid hiker 🥾, like to ride bicycles 🚴](https://www.strava.com/athletes/13914849), enjoy a good craft beer 🍺, and [I race motorcycles 🏍️](https://chriswilcox.racing).

## `where` 🌎

I live in Seattle, WA in a lovely little neighborhood called Ballard. If you enjoy [canals 🚢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballard_Locks), views of Puget Sound, a [solid craft beer 🍻](http://www.visitballard.com/craftbrews/), and being walking distance to a lot of great food 🥄, it's a pretty alright place. If you are ever in my area, feel free to ping me.
